Welcome to the **Siri Lakxmi Center For Human Rehabilitation (SLCFHR)**, where our mission is to provide compassionate care to the underprivileged sections of Sri Lankan society facing various health challenges. Our specialized services cater to individuals afflicted with conditions such as partial paralysis, facial palsy, Parkinson's disease, acute knee and joint pains, cramps, arthritis, autism, cerebral palsy in children, and more.

Since our inception six years ago, we have achieved an astonishing success rate of 95 percent. The demand for our services is steadily increasing, with both outpatients and in-patients seeking our expert care. To date, we have cared for and treated 13,000 patients, with an average of 10–15 outpatients daily. Unfortunately, due to accommodation constraints, we maintain a waiting list for those seeking in-patient treatment.

Our clinic, led by the dedicated **Dr. P. Shivapadasundaram**, affectionately known as **Dr. Shiva**, has garnered praise for its transformative impact on patients. We capture the journey of each patient, from their initial state to the joyous moments of recovery, through recorded videos. Media personnel, having witnessed these transformations, consistently commend the remarkable recoveries achieved at our center.

Dr. Shiva, known for his unconditional love and commitment to patient welfare, offers solace and encouragement. For extremely poor senior citizens and children, we provide free medicine and food. Our patients span a wide age range, from three-year-old children to individuals in their late eighties, and we extend care to everyone, regardless of religion, race, caste, or creed.

The narratives of our patients, hailing from poverty-stricken communities, are heartrending, emphasizing the need for support from fellow human beings. Dr. Shiva actively engages with the media, discussing the causes of paralysis and preventive measures. According to him, following his guidelines can lead to recovery within 30–40 days.

At the heart of our treatment approach is the application of specially prepared herbal oils, a unique blend known only to Dr. Shiva. This involves applying the oils to affected areas, limbs, and the head, targeting vital pressure points through massaging techniques.

Dr. Shiva, functioning as the primary caregiver, doctor, nurse, cook, janitor, and emotional support for our patients, embodies unwavering commitment. Despite his busy schedule, he ensures patients receive the care they need, often sleeping in the ward itself to attend to nighttime needs.

Dr. Shiva received therapeutic education and training at the renowned Siddha-Ayurveda Institute in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kerala, India. The comprehensive training included the application of oils, massaging techniques, and the practice of receiving divine blessings through meditation.

We are grateful for the support and patronage we receive from religious leaders in the community, including Buddhist temples, Christian and Catholic churches, Hindu Associations, and temples. Notably, the Venerable Poojya Unuwathura Bibile Mahinda Thero has been a steadfast supporter.

Operating in rented premises, our clinic and in-patients' ward incur significant monthly expenses amounting to **600,000 to 700,000 Sri Lankan Rupees**. These costs cover rent, utilities, salaries, patient amenities, and other contingencies. Despite these financial challenges, our commitment to providing exceptional care remains unwavering. <a href="/donate" class="text-primary">**Join us**</a> in making a difference in the lives of those in need by supporting our cause.
