### About Event

In today's digital age, social media has become an integral part of our lives, connecting us with friends, family, and the world. However, with the benefits come potential risks, and it's crucial to navigate the online landscape safely. This workshop, brought to you by SLCFHR, aims to empower participants with the knowledge and skills to use social media responsibly, protecting their privacy and well-being.

Throughout the session, we will explore practical tips on setting strong privacy settings, recognizing and avoiding online scams, understanding the impact of oversharing, and fostering a positive online presence. By the end of the workshop, participants, with the support of SLCFHR, will be equipped with the tools to make informed decisions about their digital presence, ensuring a safer and more enjoyable social media experience. Join us, a non-profit dedicated to community welfare, in this interactive and informative session to enhance your social media literacy and create a secure online environment for yourself and your community. Let's navigate the digital world together, safely and responsibly!
