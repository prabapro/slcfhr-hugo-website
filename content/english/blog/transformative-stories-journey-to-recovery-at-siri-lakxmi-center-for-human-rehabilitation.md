At Siri Lakxmi Center For Human Rehabilitation (SLCFHR), we believe in the power of transformation. Our center has been a beacon of hope for the underprivileged sections of Sri Lankan society facing various health challenges, ranging from partial paralysis to autism. In this blog post, we delve into the heartwarming stories of individuals who have undergone remarkable journeys to recovery within our care.

### A Glimpse into Our Success:

Since our inception six years ago, SLCFHR has achieved an astonishing success rate of 95 percent. Our specialized care, led by the dedicated Dr. P. Shivapadasundaram, has not only improved the lives of our patients but has also inspired our community. The stories of transformation within our clinic are a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

### From Despair to Delight:

Many of our patients arrive in a frail, helpless state, unable to move their limbs, walk, or talk. The initial stages of their arrival, recorded on video for follow-ups, depict the challenges they face. However, the joyous expressions on their faces at the prospect of regaining independence through walking, talking, and attending to personal matters on their own are truly heartening.

### Dr. Shiva's Approach:

Central to our success is Dr. Shiva's unique approach to treatment, rooted in the application of specially prepared herbal oils. The combination of ingredients known only to him, applied to affected areas and limbs, along with targeted massaging techniques, has played a crucial role in our patients' recovery.

### Beyond Treatment:

Our commitment to the well-being of our patients extends beyond the treatment itself. Dr. Shiva, often referred to as Dr. Shiva, functions as the sole caregiver, doctor, nurse, cook, janitor, and emotional support for our patients. The holistic care provided goes beyond medical intervention, fostering an environment that promotes overall healing.

### Monthly Commitment:

Operating in rented premises, the clinic and in-patients' ward incur significant monthly expenses, ranging from 600,000 to 700,000 Sri Lankan Rupees. Despite these financial challenges, our commitment to providing exceptional care remains unwavering. Your support can make a tangible impact on the lives of those in need.

In the upcoming blog posts, we will explore more about Dr. Shiva's preventive measures, the impact of our center on the community, and how you can actively contribute to our cause. Stay tuned for more inspirational stories and insights from Siri Lakxmi Center For Human Rehabilitation. Together, let's make a difference in the lives of those seeking hope and healing.
